## Installation and Setup Instructions

# Edu Care Chemnitz

This guide will help you set up the project locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Git
- Node.js and npm

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. Clone the repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone <repository-url>

2. **Install dependencies**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required npm packages:

1. backend

- `cd backend`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

2. frontend

- `cd frontend`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

3. **Environment Setup**

After installing the packages, you need to set up environment variables for the app to function correctly:

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of backend folder (where the `package.json` file is located).

- Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

  ```
  PORT=
  MONGO_URL=
  SECRET_KEY=

  ```

- MONGO_URL will look like this `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@educareapp.alfmwh9.mongodb.net/<AddDatabaseName>?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<GiveAName>`
- Replace `<username>` with username and so on.

### Important Reminder

Ensure that your `.env` file is listed in the `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive information to your Git repository by mistake.

### Running the App

Once the setup is complete, you can start the development server by running:

- `npm run dev`

This will run the app in development mode. Open `http://localhost:5173` to view it in your browser.
